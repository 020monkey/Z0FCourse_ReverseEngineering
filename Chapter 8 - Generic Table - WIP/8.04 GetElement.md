# 8.04 Get Element - WIP
Now let's look at a function that has to do with looking data up in the table. Remember, it doesn't matter which functions we reverse first. I'm choosing based on what I think will be a good order to go in.

There are multiple functions that might get something from the table: `RtlEnumerateGenericTable`, `RtlGetElementGenericTable`, `RtlLookupElementGenericTable`, and some others. Based on the names, I think `RtlGetElementGenericTable` or `RtlLookupElementGenericTable` will be the easiest. Out of those two I'd guess `RtlGetElementGenericTable` will be the simplest. I'd guess that it simply looks in the table at the index passed to the function. This is just a guess, I don't even know what parameters it takes yet.

Disassembly of `RtlGetElementGenericTable`:
```asm
7FF8BBD1C1B0    MOV QWORD PTR SS:[RSP+0x8], RBX
7FF8BBD1C1B5    MOV R10D, DWORD PTR DS:[RCX+0x20]
7FF8BBD1C1B9    LEA R11D, QWORD PTR DS:[RDX+0x1]

7FF8BBD1C212    MOV R8, QWORD PTR DS:[R8+0x8]
7FF8BBD1C216    ADD EAX, EBX
7FF8BBD1C218    JE ntdll.7FF8BBD1C1F8
7FF8BBD1C21A    JMP ntdll.7FF8BBD1C212
7FF8BBD1C21C    XOR EAX, EAX
7FF8BBD1C21E    JMP ntdll.7FF8BBD1C204
```

Before we get into this function, I'm going to offer you a hint, otherwise you may get very confused. If you don't want the hint, move on. If you're not sure if you want the hint, I'll let you know that is has to do with a computer science topic. More specifically, data structures. Now for the spoiler. This function is going to deal with a splay tree. For our purposes we can view it as a linked list. We can figure this out by reversing, but if you don't know these topics you will be very confused. If you need to, go learn these topics before continuing.

### General Overview
When a function is pretty involved, I always like going through it and identifying the obvious stuff, then going back through and analyzing more closely. This will help me get a general idea of what's going on. The first thing we'll do is check for function parameters.
* RCX is used like a data structure (`MOV EAX, DWORD PTR DS:[RCX+0x24]`), so it's probably the table like usual.
* RDX is also used, but with an offset of +0x1 (`LEA R11D, QWORD PTR DS:[RDX+0x1]`). RDX could be a data structure, maybe a pointer, or maybe it's just being incremented. We'll figure that out later, just note that RDX is used.
* R8 and R9 are overwritten, so they're probably not parameters.
We can guess that this function only takes 2 parameters. The first one being the table, the second one is only a guess but, based on the function name, it could be the index to find.

There are two jumps that are interesting, which go to `ntdll.7FF8BBD1C21C`. `ntdll.7FF8BBD1C21C` will set the return value to zero, then jump to `ntdll.7FF8BBD1C204` where RBX is restored. Finally, the function returns. This is likely a fail condition.

>If you don't already, I'd highly recommend writing notes and/or pseudo code as you are reverse engineering.

# Part 1
Let's focus on the following portion of code:
```asm
MOV QWORD PTR SS:[RSP+0x8], RBX
MOV R10D, DWORD PTR DS:[RCX+0x20]
LEA R11D, QWORD PTR DS:[RDX+0x1]
MOV R8, QWORD PTR DS:[RCX+0x18]
OR EBX, 0xFFFFFFFF
MOV R9D, R11D
CMP EDX, EBX
JE ntdll.7FF8BBD1C21C
MOV EAX, DWORD PTR DS:[RCX+0x24]
CMP R11D, EAX
JA ntdll.7FF8BBD1C21C
```
* RBX is preserved/saved on the stack.
* `Table->Member5` is moved into R10D.
* `LEA R11D, QWORD PTR DS:[RDX+0x1]` is an interesting instruction. It's essentially `R11D = RDX + 1`. This might be done instead of using `INC` to preserve the value of RDX.
* Next, the fourth member of the table is moved into R8.
* `OR EBX, 0xFFFFFFFF` sets EBX to -1.
* R11D (RDX + 1) is moved into R9D. Again, this is a little weird at first, why not just use R11D? This is probably done to preserve R11D.
* EDX (second parameter) is then compared to EBX (-1). This tells us a few things. First, we can be even more sure that EDX is an index. Also, this further suggests that the NumberOfElements member is 4 bytes unlike the others, and is at offset +24.
  * If the index is -1, then jump to `ntdll.7FF8BBD1C21C` which is the fail condition.
* `MOV EAX, DWORD PTR DS:[RCX+0x24]` moves the NumberOfElements member into EAX.
* R11D (Index + 1) is then checked if it's greater than EAX (NumberOfElements). This is just some more index validation. This also tells us another piece of useful information, the index is zero-based. This means it starts from index zero, not 1, similar to a conventional array. This makes sense because the number of elements is *not* zero-based (0 elements would mean it's empty). Again, this is just like an array.
  * If R11D is greater than EAX, then it jumps to the fail condition. `JA` tells us that it's unsigned.

Here is some pseudo code to ease your mind:
```c
ULONG adjustedIndex = index + 1;
if(index == -1 || adjustedIndex > Table->NumberOfElements){
    return 0;
}
```
