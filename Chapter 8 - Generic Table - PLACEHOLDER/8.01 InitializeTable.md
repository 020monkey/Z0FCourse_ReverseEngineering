# 8.01 Initialize Table
Based on the function names we can guess that the "Generic Table" is probably some kind of data structure. Because of this, it's probably a good idea to start by looking at the initialization function(s). This will hint at what the table contains, or at least how many things it contains.

#### Disassembly of `RtlInitializeGenericTable`:
```asm
LEA RAX, QWORD PTR DS:[RCX + 0x8]
XOR R10D, R10D
MOV QWORD PTR DS:[RCX], R10
MOV QWORD PTR DS:[RAX + 0x8], RAX
MOV QWORD PTR DS:[RAX], RAX
MOV QWORD PTR DS:[RCX + 0x18], RAX
MOV RAX, QWORD PTR SS:[RSP + 0x28]
MOV QWORD PTR DS:[RCX + 0x40], RAX
MOV QWORD PTR DS:[RCX + 0x20], R10
MOV QWORD PTR DS:[RCX + 0x28], RDX
MOV QWORD PTR DS:[RCX + 0x30], R8
MOV QWORD PTR DS:[RCX + 0x38], R9
RET 
```

Before we start digging into the `GenericTable` data structure, let's take a look at what the initialization function is doing.

RCX, RDX, R8, and R9 are all being used. This means that there is likely at least 4 parameters.
Right away we can see that RCX is some kind of data structure, probably a generic structure. This tells us that the first parameter of this function is a generic table, which we'll just call a table for simplicity. We can also see RD
