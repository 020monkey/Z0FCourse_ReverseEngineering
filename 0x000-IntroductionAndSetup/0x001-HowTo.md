# How To Follow This Course
The courses are structured like so:

Any folders or files with a name surrounded with square brackets, such as "[ignore]", are not important. It's usually something like the images used in the course. If there are multiple parts to one section, they will be in numerical order if necessary. Any important information will be in files with the "@" prefix.

Everything should have a unique address so if you have any questions, just ask with the specific number. Here's an example tweet: "@0xZ0F there is a spelling mistake in 0x001." The number for a chapter or section may change in the future especially if the content is a work in progress.

Each folder (Ex. 0x000-IntroductionAndSetup) is a **chapter**. Each piece of content (Ex. 0x001-HowTo.md) is a **section**.

I use some technical lingo and abbreviations. If you don't know what they mean or forget what they mean, go to [Lingo.md](Lingo.md).
