# CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT (0xFFF - Windows)

> 0xFFF is temporary. It will probably set it to 0x600 (Malware) and the current 0x600 will be moved to 0x700.

## This section is currently in development and is **NOT** ready.

This chapter will discuss some of the inner workings of Microsoft Windows. The chapter will focus on what is relevant to the field of reverse engineering. We'll cover things such as processes, memory, threads, the kernel, data structures, and more.

* ### [0xFFF - Windows](0xFFF-Windows.md)
    * [0xFFF - Assembly](0xFFF-Windows.md)


# TODO (No order):
* Virtual addresses.
* SEH
* Rings
* Kernel
* Structures (P/T/EB/IB)
* PE Layout

More later, that's all that is planned for now.
