# 7.3 Architecture - WIP
As already discussed, Windows separates kernel-mode and user-mode. However, Windows doesn't stop there. Various other components are separated and organized in a structure-like way. Windows is built with an object-oriented design, although this is more apparent with  kernel-mode components because mostly everything there runs together. User-mode is not as object-oriented because most of the components don't work together.

It's important to point out that this object-oriented design pertains to the components, not necessarily the underlying code. While the system components work in an object-oriented way, the OS is written in C which is not an *object-oriented programming* (OOP) language. This becomes apparent when looking at low-level structures (C doesn't have classes). Structures in C don't have any sort of OOP functionality. In C there is no structure inheritance, methods, constructors, etc.

### Service vs Process
It's important to know the difference between a service and a process. A Windows service is just a daemon. A daemon is a program that runs in the background and is controlled by the OS, not the user. A process is similar, except it can be started or interacted with by a user. An example of a process is the logon process. An example of a service is the user manager. You interact with the logon process by entering a username and password. You don't interact with the user manager, it manages users in the background. Defining something as a process or service can be tricky and there are often processes that you would think are services, and services you would think are processes.

## Layout
Here is a simplified view of the Windows architecture layout:

First off, notice the kernel-mode and user-mode separation. Also notice that the hypervisor is being shown in its own kernel-mode context, note however, the hypervisor runs in normal kernel-mode.

### User-Mode:
* **Environment Subsystems** - This is essentially what users and programmers are presented. Think of it as the underlying implementation of the overall environment/personality presented to the OS users and programmers. There are three main subsystems which are Windows, POSIX, and OS/2. OS/2 was last used in Windows 2000. POSIX was replaced by the *Subsystem for Unix-based Applications* (SUA) which was then replaced with *Windows Subsystem for Linux* (WSL).
* **User Processes** - Conventional processes started and ran in user-mode.
* **Service Processes** - These host Windows services such as the *Task Scheduler*. These usually run along with the OS, meaning it doesn't matter if a user is logged in or not. If the OS is running, they're running.
* **System Processes** - Fixed/hard-coded processes (not services).

You may notice that service and user processes run into subsystem DLLs. This is because user-mode applications don't call the native Windows OS services directly. Instead they go through subsystem DLLs. The role of these DLLs is to translate document and public function calls into the internal (typically undocumented) native system functions. Most of these functions/services are implemented in NTDLL.dll.
