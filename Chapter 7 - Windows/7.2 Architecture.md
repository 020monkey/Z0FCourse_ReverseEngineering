# 7.2 Architecture - WIP
As already discussed, Windows separates kernel-mode and user-mode. However, Windows doesn't stop there. Various other components are separated and organized in a structure-like way. Windows is built with an object-oriented design, although this is more apparent with  kernel-mode components because mostly everything there runs together. User-mode is not as object-oriented because most of the components don't work together. 

It's important to point out that this object-oriented design pertains to the components, not necessarily the underlying code. While the system components work in an object-oriented way, the OS is written in C which is not an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. This becomes apparent when looking at low-level structures (C doesn't have classes). Structures (structs) in C don't have any sort of OOP functionality. In C there is no structure inheritance, methods, constructors, etc.

## Layout
Here is a simplified view of the Windows architecture layout:
