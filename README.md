## Important Notes:
THIS COURSE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! I'm no where near done, but feel free to watch the course develop over time! If you have any feedback or suggestions let me know on Twitter! If you would like to know a little of what I have planned, see the content inside of the [DOC](DOC) folder.

I use some technical lingo and abbreviations. If you forget what they mean, or don't know what they mean, go to [Lingo.md](Lingo.md).

The course folders are organized in a specific way. Any folders or files with a name surrounded with square brackets, such as "[ignore]", are not important. It's usually something like the images used in the course.
