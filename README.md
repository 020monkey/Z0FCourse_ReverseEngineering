## What We'll Do/Learn:
This course is going to teach anyone how to reverse engineer x64 Windows. We will start by covering some basics of binaries, then reverse some small samples, then move to a full program, the finally we will reverse a DLL and implement it into our own program. There will also be extra content at the end which will briefly cover other topics such as x86 and Linux.
