# 0x001 - How To Follow This Course

## File Structure:

Any folders or files with a name surrounded with square brackets, such as "[ignore]", are not important. They usually contain things like images used in the course. **All course content should be numbered in pseudo-hexadecimal (not completely accurate hexadecimal). The reason why the courses aren't numbered with actual hexadecimal is down to sorting the courses by name. For example, in hexadecimal 0x10A comes after 0x109. However, when sorting by name in a conventional file browser, 0x10A comes before 0x109 (and even 0x100). Because of this, I would have to give it a name like 0x110.** Feel free to use these numbers when asking questions or making comments. Here's an example tweet: "@0xZ0F there is a spelling mistake in 0x101." Be cautious though, The number for a chapter or section may change in the future.

* Each folder (Ex. [0x000-Introduction](0x000-Introduction)) is a **chapter**.
* Each file (Ex. [0x001-HowTo.md](0x001-HowTo.md)) is a **section**.

I use some technical lingo and abbreviations. If you're unsure what they mean, go to [Lingo.md](../Lingo.md).

If you haven't already, please read [README.md](../README.md).
