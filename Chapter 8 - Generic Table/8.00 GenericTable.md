# Chapter 8 - Generic Table - WIP
This chapter is going to cover reversing parts of a real DLL. The DLL covered is going to be NTDLL.dll, specifically the Generic Table (GT) functions. I'm choosing the generic table functions because they are semi-documented (so we can check our work), there are multiple functions, and they cover a variety of concepts.
